title: "My Story"
---

I was born in **Beijing**, the city that shaped the first eighteen years of my life. Beijing is a complex city — where history and modernity, tranquility and vibrancy coexist. My high school was located in a traditional hutong in the very center of the city, only two kilometers from Tiananmen Square. After three years of study there, I was admitted to the School of Economics at **Shandong University** with a score of 640, ranking around 3000th in Beijing, where I majored in Finance (Financial Mathematics track).

My two years at Shandong University were deeply fulfilling. I ranked first in my major while actively participating in student clubs and sports teams, receiving several awards and forming many lasting friendships. Yet I began to ask myself: should I continue spending the next two years in my comfort zone? I chose not to. Instead, I traveled to the Southern Hemisphere in search of new challenges.

Of course, this decision was driven by more than a desire for change. Over time, I realized that I have a genuine aptitude for research. I consistently performed at the top of my classes and found great satisfaction in immersing myself in rigorous study and deep analytical thinking. I decided to pursue an academic path, and Australia offered a strong stepping stone toward top PhD programs in the United States.

I then came to **the University of Queensland** as an exchange student, where I accomplished more than I had imagined possible. Due to program constraints, I was limited to taking courses in Economics and Mathematics. I overloaded every semester and completed two years’ worth of coursework in just one and a half years, graduating from UQ with a perfect GPA of 7. Many of my course grades were 100 — particularly in mathematics — which surprised and impressed several professors. At the same time, I participated in two research programs and found two exceptionally supportive supervisors, who later became my Honours advisors.

The story continues. I have now begun my Honours degree, and new challenges lie ahead.
