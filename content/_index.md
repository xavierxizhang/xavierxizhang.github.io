I am currently an **Honours student in Economics** at the University of Queensland (UQ), supervised by Dr Allan Hernandez Chanto and Prof Claudio Mezzetti. I am research-oriented, with a particular interest in **microeconomic theory**, and I aspire to pursue a top PhD program in the United States and contribute to the world.

I am also an **academic tutor** in both the School of Economics and the School of Mathematics and Physics at UQ; you can find more information about my teaching in the **“Teaching”** section.
